# Speed typing game

Simple speed typing game made with HTML, CSS and Angular.

## Description

Try to type the words as fast as you can. The game will start when you type the first letter. The game will end when you type the last letter of the last word. The game will show you the time it took to type all the words and the accuracy of your typing.

## Getting Started

## To-Do's

- [] Create a display box for a paragraph of text that the user will type
- [] Create an input box for the user to type the displayed text
- [] Highlight the character of the word users are currently typing (in the display box):
    - [] GREEN - letter is correct
    - [] RED - letter is wrong
- [] Create a START button for the test to begin
- [] Create a display box for the countdown timer
    - [] Set a countdown time for each test
    - [] Activate the timer when the user clicks on START    
- [] When the timer runs out, display how many words the user typed per minute

## Optional To-Do's

- [] Create a drop down menu where the user can select the difficulty of the text (i.e. easy, medium, difficult). Based on the user’s selection, display the selected text.
- [] Calculate the accuracy (%) of the user’s inputs
- [] Give different words different weights: simple words like “a”, “the”, “an” etc. should weigh less than difficult words like “friendship” and “neighborhood”
- [] Allow users to see only one line of text, rather than the entire paragraph
- [] Create different types of tests for different use cases: text only, numbers only, emoji only, etc.
